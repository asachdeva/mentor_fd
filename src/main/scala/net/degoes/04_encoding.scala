/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * In Functional Design, there are two ways to encode functional domain
 * constructors and operators:
 *
 * 1. Using a function or interface, whose methods execute the solution. This is
 *    called the "executable" encoding in this course. It's a direct, executable
 *    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain is modeled with a class
 *    or case class, or an open trait that is implemented by classes, then it's
 *    probably an executable encoding.
 *
 * 2. Using a pure data structure, which declaratively describes the solution, but
 *    which does not perform the solution. It's an abstract, "declarative"
 *    encoding of a domain. If some functional domain type is modeled with a
 *    sealed trait, then it's probably an abstract encoding, where the subtypes
 *    of the sealed trait model individual operations and constructors in the
 *    domain.
 *
 * In the second encoding, a so-called "executor" or "interpreter" or "compiler"
 * translates the data structure, which merely models a solution, into either
 * executable code or into another lower-level domain, which provides the
 * capabilities modeled by the functional domain.
 *
 * Executable encodings are "open": anyone can add new constructors and
 * operators, without updating existing code. On the other hand, executable
 * encodings are not "introspectable": because they are not data, but rather,
 * opaque executable machinery, they cannot be serialized, optimized, or
 * converted to other encodings.
 *
 * Abstract encodings are "introspectable": because they are pure data, they
 * can be serialized, optimized, and converted to other encodings, assuming
 * their component parts have the same properties (not all abstract encodings
 * do; if you embed a function inside an abstract encoding, it's becomes
 * opaque). On the other hand, abstract encodings are "closed": no one can add
 * new constructors or operators, without updating existing code.
 *
 * Summarizing the difference between executable and abstract encodings:
 *
 *  - Executable encodings have open constructors/operators, but closed
 *    interpreters.
 *  - Declarative encodings have closed constructors/operators, but open
 *    interpreters.
 *
 * Note: Tagless-final an executable encoding, but where by making the "solutions"
 * polymorphic, the choice of executor can be deferred arbitrarily.
 *
 * Legacy code prefers executable encodings; while many benefits of Functional
 * Design can be seen best using abstract encodings.
